# Prolog Programming for Artificial Intelligence

Project Topic: Build a prolog application with BFS for finding shortest path between two elements.

- Application must be use BFS algorithm.
- Keywords must be taken from user.
- User should enter an array and mode with that modes app should be able to block or enable paths.
- Connections must be evaluated in both direction
- Full path and passed elements must printed as an output.
