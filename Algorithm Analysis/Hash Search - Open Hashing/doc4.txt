The Longest Text Ever
An attempt at creating the longest wall of text ever written Check out some other LTEs

Hello everyone This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER I was inspired by the various other longest texts ever on the internet and I wanted to make my own So here it is This is going to be a WORLD RECORD This is actually my third attempt at doing this The first time I didnt save it The second time the Neocities editor crashed Now Im writing this in Notepad then copying it into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid crashing It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now Those actually got pretty long Not the longest but still pretty long I hope this one wont get lost somehow Anyways lets talk about WAFFLES I like waffles Waffles are cool Waffles is a funny word Theres a Teen Titans Go episode called Waffles where the word Waffles is said a hundredsomething times Its pretty annoying Theres also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin Dont know what Pig Latin is Its a language where you take all the consonants before the first vowel move them to the end and add ay to the end If the word begins with a vowel you just add way to the end For example Waffles becomes Afflesway Ive been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the fourth grade so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time I speak Pig Latin with my sister sometimes Its pretty fun I like speaking it in public so that everyone around us gets confused Thats never actually happened before but if it ever does twill be pretty funny By the way twill is a word I invented recently and its a contraction of it will I really hope it gains popularity in the near future because twill is WAY more fun than saying itll Itll is too boring Nobody likes boring This is nowhere near being the longest text ever but eventually it will be I might still be writing this a decade later who knows But right now its not very long But Ill just keep writing until it is the longest Have you ever heard the song Dau Dau by Awesome Scampis Its an amazing song Look it up on YouTube I play that song all the time around my sister It drives her crazy and I love it Another way I like driving my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her She hates the languages I make The only language that we both speak besides English is Pig Latin I think you already knew that Whatever I think Im gonna go for now Bye Hi Im back now Im gonna contribute more to this soontobe giant wall of text I just realised I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed I forgot his name Im pretty sure it was something stupid though I think it was FROG in Morse Code or something Morse Code is cool I know a bit of it but Im not very good at it Im also not very good at French I barely know anything in French and my pronunciation probably sucks But Im learning it at least Im also learning Esperanto Its this language that was made up by some guy a long time ago to be the universal language A lot of people speak it I am such a language nerd Half of this text is probably gonna be about languages But hey as long as its long Ha get it As LONG as its LONG Im so funny right No Im not I should probably get some sleep Goodnight Hello Im back again I basically have only two interests nowadays languages and furries What Oh sorry I thought you knew I was a furry Haha oops Anyway yeah Im a furry but since Im a young furry I cant really do as much as I would like to do in the fandom When Im older I would like to have a fursuit go to furry conventions all that stuff But for now I can only dream of that Sorry you had to deal with me talking about furries but Im honestly very desperate for this to be the longest text ever Last night I was watching nothing but fursuit unboxings I think I need help This one time me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party but we didnt end up going because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises and that she didnt wanna have to be a mom dragging her son through a crowd of furries Both of those reasons were understandable Okay hopefully I wont have to talk about furries anymore I dont care if youre a furry reading this right now I just dont wanna have to torture everyone else I will no longer say the F word throughout the rest of this entire text Of course by the F word I mean the one that I just used six times not the one that youre probably thinking of which I have not used throughout this entire text I just realised that next year will be Thats crazy It just feels so futuristic Its also crazy that the s decade is almost over That decade brought be a lot of memories In fact it brought be almost all of my memories Itll be sad to see it go Im gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona Ill expain what Toki Pona is after I come back Bye Im back now and I decided not to do it on Toki Pona since many other people have done Toki Pona video lessons already I decided to do it on Viesa my English code Now I shall explain what Toki Pona is Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language that has only ~ words That means you can learn it very quickly I reccomend you learn it Its pretty fun and easy Anyway yeah I might finish my video about Viesa later But for now Im gonna add more to this giant wall of text because I want it to be the longest It would be pretty cool to have a world record for the longest text ever Not sure how famous Ill get from it but itll be cool nonetheless Nonetheless Thats an interesting word Its a combination of three entire words Thats pretty neat Also remember when I said that I said the F word six times throughout this text I actually messed up there I actually said it ten times including the plural form Im such a liar I struggled to spell the word liar there I tried spelling it lyer then lier Then I remembered that its liar At least Im better at spelling than my sister Shes younger than me so I guess its understandable Understandable is a pretty long word Hey I wonder what the most common word Ive used so far in this text is I checked and appearantly its I with uses The word I makes up % of the words this text I wouldve thought the would be the most common but the is only the second most used word with uses It is the third most common followed by a and to Congrats to those five words If youre wondering what the least common word is well its actually a tie between a bunch of words that are only used once and I dont wanna have to list them all here Remember when I talked about waffles near the beginning of this text Well I just put some waffles in the toaster and I got reminded of the very beginnings of this longest text ever Okay that was literally yesterday but I dont care You cant see me right now but Im typing with my nose Okay I was not able to type the exclamation point with just my nose I had to use my finger But still I typed all of that sentence with my nose Im not typing with my nose right now because it takes too long and I wanna get this text as long as possible quickly Im gonna take a break for now Bye Hi Im back again My sister is beside me watching me write in this endless wall of text My sister has a new thing where she just says the word poop nonstop I dont really like it She also eats her own boogers Im not joking Shes gross like that Also remember when I said I put waffles in the toaster Well I forgot about those and I only ate them just now Now my sister is just saying random numbers Now shes saying that theyre not random theyre the numbers being displayed on the microwave Still I dont know why shes doing that Now shes making annoying clicking noises Now shes saying that shes gonna watch Friends on three different devices Why Hi its me his sister Id like to say that all of that is not true Max wants to make his own video but i wont let him because i need my phone for my alarmPOOP POOP POOP POOP LOL IM FUNNY Hey Im back Sorry about my sister I had to seize control of the LTE from her because she was doing keymash Keymash is just effortless She just went back to school She comes home from school for her lunch break I think Im gonna go again Bye Hello Im back Lets compare LTEs This one is only characters long so far Kenneth Imans LTE is characters long The FlamingChicken LTE the original is a whopping characters long I think Ill be able to surpass Kenneth Imans not long from now But my goal is to surpass the FlamingChicken LTE Actually I just figured out that theres an LTE longer than the FlamingChicken LTE Its Hermnerps LTE which is only slightly longer than the FlamingChicken LTE at characters My goal is to surpass THAT Then Ill be the world record holder I think But Ill still be writing this even after I achieve the world record of course One time I printed an entire copy of the Bee Movie script for no reason I heard someone else say they had three copies of the Bee Movie script in their backpack and I got inspired But I only made one copy because I didnt want to waste THAT much paper I still wasted quite a bit of paper though Now I wanna see how this LTE compares to the Bee Movie script Okay I checked and the Bee Movie script is characters long Not as long as some of the LTEs I mentioned but still longer than mine and Kenneth Imans combined This LTE is getting close to characters That means itll be half the length of Kenneth Imans LTE Thats pretty exciting Also going back to the topic of the Bee Movie Script I tried to write the entire thing out by hand once But I never finished it especially since Im focusing on this thing now Maybe I should write this LTE out by hand Nah I dont think I will Yay were at characters Lets celebrate by talking about MUSIC Music is cool That concludes our celebratory discussion about music Thank you and have a good rest of your day Hi Im back now and I got a book Its a dictionary for a language called Elefen Its like Esperanto but better Now I can learn Elefen even without internet Thats pretty cool I will now write something in Elefen See if you can understand it Here goes Si tu pote leje esta tu es merveliosa Elefen es un lingua multe fresca Did you understand that Maybe you cant speak Elefen but you still understood that because of your knowledge of other languages Elefen is cool because its an actual language not an English code like Pig Latin or Viesa Oh I forgot to mention that my sister is back from school Shes blasting Rhett and Link songs right now Have you seen that picture of Rhett and Link standing with a bunch of Sorry I almost said the F word there That wouldve broken my rule of not saying the F word I wrote something in Elefen so I will also write something in Toki Pona See if you can understand it now sina sona e toki mi la sina pona mute a I can speak Toki Pona fluently by the way Its also a pretty cool language My sister is still playing annoying songs Its hindering my focus right now But its fiiiiine Okay luckily shes run out of songs to play At least for now Shes trying to think of another annoying song to play Now shes playing a song by Green Day Not NEARLY as bad as the other songs she just played I should go for now Goodbye Hello Im back once again I dont know why I feel obligated to say that every time I come back But Ill keep doing it anyway My sister stopped blasting annoying songs so thats good Shes cooking something in the microwave Ill go check to see what it is right now Nevermind its already done cooking Right I remember Its mac and cheese Now she just started singing I have a tongue you dont because I cut it off yesterday I dont know what goes on in her mind when she does stuff like that Ive been messing around with my Elefen dictionary for a while looking up whatever random words I can think of By the way the whole reason Im doing this longest text ever is because of pointlesssitescom Thats how I found the FlamingChicken LTE which inspired me to start writing this LTE So thanks pointlesssitescom I check that website every day to see what new pointless websites they add You know I could double every letter I type so that this text would be twice as long as it normally would be But nah thats kinda cheating So I wont Also SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE There I did my part Not that anyone will read this but still Twould be nice if you subscribed to PewDiePie Thats another word I invented Actually I looked it up and I didnt invent it Someone came up with it before I did Thats pretty sad Also LEARN VIESA TODAY IT WILL CURE YOUR DEPRESSION Seriously though learn Viesa It wont actually cure your depression but Im desperate for speakers I only have one other person to speak it with I should go now Goodbye Hi Im back I just came up with an idea SIMPLIFIED ENGLISH Or in Simplified Engish Simifid Enis Its where every group of consonant letters is reduced to the first consonant in that group of consonants and same goes with the vowels If a word ends up being just a single consonant with no vowel put a at the end So I like eating my waffles becomes I like etin ma wafes Isnt it the most amazing thing ever Nah its not quite as amazing as Viesa Actually Viesa isnt a real language so its less amazing then Elefen and Toki Pona both of which are cool languages I kinda figured that half of this text would be about languages Oh well I just really want this to be the longest text ever without using copy and paste keymash etc If you remember my sister did a little bit of keymash in this text a while ago I wouldve deleted it but nah I didnt feel like it And besides its not like it took up half this text I have an estimate for how long itll take me to be the world record holder about one month I think I can manage one month of writing this You know what Im just gonna break my rule of not saying the word furry There I said it Now Im allowing myself to write furry whenever I want So with that out of the way lets talk about how I first became a furry For some reason I have the exact date when I became a furry memorized Its May At that time I discovered that I was a furry by watching some furry YouTube videos I knew about the existence of furries years before this but I didnt know much about it until this time I said to myself You know what Im a furry now and thats what started it all And Ive been slowly learning more about the fandom ever since I would like to participate more in the fandom when Im older but Im too young for most of it right now Guess Ill just have to wait But in the meantime I can write about it in this text I should sleep now Goodnight Hello Im back once again Happy Pi Day I memorized a bunch of digits of Pi once not sure how many I still remember I have literally nothing to write about now Ive been trying to come up with something for the past minutes and I still have no idea Literally nothing is happening right now Its pretty boring My sister is watching Friends as usual Okay since theres nothing for me to write about I should go now Bye Wow it has been a while since I last added to this It is now July Last time I edited this page was Pi Day which was March Those months of this thing being untouched end today Wait months That means I was supposed to get this past the world record three months ago Oh well I have put many things into this text A lot of them were cringy like how I keep mentioning furryrelated things You know I should stop putting things in here when I know Im gonna cringe at them later Ill try not to do that from here on out I just know Ill fail though Id hate to be aware of someone reading this entire thing like if I had to sit and watch a family member or something read this entire text I would cringe so hard I would not want that to happen I am currently pasting the entirety of the FlamingChicken LTE onto a page on OurWorldOfText The frustrating thing about pasting stuff there is that it pastes one letter at a time so it takes forever to paste long text And when the tab isnt open Im pretty sure it just stops pasting so you have to keep the tab open if you want it to continue Why am I even doing this No idea I might not even paste the whole thing I probably wont Hey I just had a thought What if in the future students are reading this for a class assignment What if this LTE becomes part of the school curriculum If so hi future student I hope youre enjoying reading my CRINGE What is my life coming to Thats enough writing for now Goodbye Hey again Might as well continue writing in here for a bit Hey have you ever heard of D Movie Maker Its a program from the s that still works on modern computers where you can make D animated movies Its pretty cool Ive made a few movies with it myself and many other people use it to make interesting stuff In case you want to try it for yourself Im sure if you google dmm download or something like that it will take you somewhere where you can download the program Its kinda aimed at younger children but hopefully that doesnt stop you from making absolute masterpieces with this program I have a keyboard in my room the musical kind not the one you type words on and I dont really know how to play it properly but I do it anyways I can play a few songs on the piano albeit with weird fingering because like I just said I have no idea what Im doing including HOME Resonance and PilotRedSun Bodybuilder You might not know one or both of those songs If you dont know one of them why not google it You will have discovered some new music and it will all be because of me Why are you reading this anyways How did you even find it Were you like me and you were browsing pointlesssitescom eventually finding the FlamingChicken LTE and going down a rabbit hole of discovering random LTEs Literally the only reason Im writing this right now is because that happened I just discovered a new LTE the RainbowFluffySheep LTE Im gonna see how many characters long it is characters Pretty long but not as long as the top two LTEs FlamingChicken and Hermnerps both with around characters I wanna write as much as possible into this text today Im gonna see how much LTEwriting I can do in one day Hopefully its a lot because I wanna hold a world record Imagine having a world record Well would it really be a world record Because I dont know of any world record books that have Longest Text Ever as a record Oh well I just hope this LTE passes exactly characters Thats all my goal is Im not even a tenth of the way there yet but give it a month and Im sure Ill get there Hey remember last time I said it would only take a month That was four months ago I should just stop promising things all together at this point Forget I said anything about that Did you know my sister has an LTE Thats right Its not very long though and you cant read it because its on her phone She made it while bored at the library That library was where I used to have web design classes Those were fun but I dont do them anymore Now all I do it sit at home and write stuff in here Well Im exaggerating I go to the convenience store with my sister sometimes But thats pretty much it outside of being bored on a computer I should be a less boring human being One day I should translate this entire LTE into Viesa That would be a big waste of time even bigger than writing the LTE itself But I could still do it I dont think I ever will This text is simply too long and itll be even longer than that by the time I pass characters By the way if you think Im gonna stop writing this once I pass characters youre wrong Because Ill keep writing this even after I pass that point Itll feel nice to be way ahead the record My sisters alarm clock has been going off for half an hour and I havent turned it off Why Because LAZYNESS Actually I really should turn it off now There I turned it off First when I tried to turn it off it started playing the radio Then I tried again and it turned off completely Then I hurt myself on the door while walking out So that was quite the adventure Im gonna go sleep now Goodnight Hey Im back again My computer BSODd while writing this so I have to start this section over again Thats why you save your work kids Before I had to start over again I was talking about languages Yes I decided to bring that topic back after a while But I no longer want to talk about it Why Because itll probably bore you to death That is assuming youre reading this at all Who knows maybe absolutely zero people will read this within the span of the universes existence But I doubt that Theres gotta be someone wholl find this text and dedicate their time to reading it even if it takes thousands of years for that to happen What will happen to this LTE in a thousand years Will the entire internet dissapear within that time In that case will this text dissapear with it Or will it along with the rest of what used to be the internet be preserved somewhere Im thinking out loud right now Well not really out loud because Im typing this and you cant technically be loud through text THE CLOSEST THING IS TYPING IN ALL CAPS Imagine if I typed this entire text like that That would be painful I decided to actually save my work this time in case of another crash I already had my two past attempts at an LTE vanish from existance I mean most of this LTE is already stored on Neocities so I probably wont need to worry about anything I think I might change the LTE page a little I want the actual text area to be larger Im gonna make it a very basic HTML page with just a header and text Maybe with some CSS coloring I dont know Screw it Im gonna do it There now the text area is larger It really does show how small this LTE is so far compared to FlamingChicken or Hermnerps But at least I made the background a nice Alice Blue Thats the name of the CSS color I used Its pretty light Were getting pretty close to the / mark Thats the point where were one tenth of the way to making this the longest text ever meaning all I have to do is write the equivalent of everything Ive already written so far nine more times Not gonna make any promises though How come every time I try to type though it comes out as thought Why do I always type the extra T Its so annoying that I have to delete the T every time Okay only mildly annoying Not as annoying as I previously described I apologize for my exaggeration of the annoyance level of me typing thought instead of though I just realized that most of the games I play are games that Ive been playing for at least six years I started playing Garrys Mod in Minecraft in whatever year version came out Now I have to look that up March So I started playing Minecraft approximately during that time Wow seven years ago Coincidentally I was also seven years old then I remember the days of That was when I still played Roblox and made terrible YouTube videos I was called Infinite Budgets back then I also remember the days of A lot of people thought that was a terrible year but for me personally it brings me a lot of nostalgia because I talked a lot with my online friend at the time and I did livestreams on YouTube and stuff It was fun was also when I got the phone that I still have to this day Yup my phone is three years old My life was completely different when I got this phone I was years old my YouTube channel actually had activity and I wasnt writing this text Im currently writing this in the car We are on out way to the dollar store And since Im writing this on my phone Im making a lot more typos than usual Some of them might make it through so be prepared for that Anyways we appear to be getting close to the dollar store I have a gift card for that place I think so anyways it might be for a different store Yup this dollar store is different Oh well My sister has an obsession with sponges Im sure shes gonna find the sponges and go crazy over them Why does she like sponges so much No idea She just found a bag of tiny baby dolls and she wants to put them in ice cubes and call it Ice Ice Baby She is truly a strange human being My sister also has an obsession with stuffies She has such an addiction that shes banned from them Now she found the wigs and shes considering buying one Shes been looking at them for quite a while now Were out of the dollar store and now were going to the computer store I have no idea why were here I guess we just are Now were going home Welp that was a fun adventure Stay tuned for more fun adventures as you read through this LTE I should go now Bye Hello again I made a private world on OurWorldOfText for my sister and I but she doesnt want to join it She doesnt think itll be fun Now Im just editing it alone How sad But oh well Now Im here adding more to this text I once made a Discord server specifically for a language called Bo where the only word is bo I made it almost four months ago and somehow its still going People are still spamming nothing but bo there Its great I also once made a server where youre not allowed to use any vowels It was a very strange server I deleted it after some time though so all that insanity is no more I also used to own a Pig Latin server but it got inactive so I deleted that too We had some good memories in that server though Now theres a new Pig Latin server but its not owned by me Dang my YouTube channel has been dead for so long I havent posted a video in a year I want to revive it but I dont know what to post there Ill figure it out I doubt my channel will ever go back to its legacy but Im sure Ill post something eventually Random fact of the day there are thirtynine question marks so far in this text Am I about to make it forty Yes I just did Now the fact I initially stated is no longer true Or is it Because I said so far in the fact that implies that were talking about the moment that fact was said disregarding any future events Now Im pretty sure that fact is still technically true Welp I guess I should just accept that Im editing that world of text alone for the rest of my life I originally put a bunch of complaining in there but I deleted it all The thing is now that world will never be same without all of that complaining about my sister not being here But thats fine Hey I just had a cool realization Basically theres this conlang constructed language for those not in the know server where we have a Sentence of the Week activity In this activity someone posts a text with a maximum of nine sentences then people translate it into their own conlangs My realization is this if we take nine sentences from this LTE every week there would be a whole year of sentences for people to translate There are approximantly sentences in this LTE Divide that by sentences each week and you get weeks worth of sentences which is approximantly the number of weeks in a year Quick maths I actually suck at math but thats besides the point I should go now Goodbye Hello Im back again I really need to come up with different hello and goodbye messages because Ive already said Hello Im back again once before Same with the I should go now Goodbye I said at the end of the previous section I was going to explain what a section is but Im terrible at explaining things so Im not going to anymore I guess youll just have to figure it out yourself Its probably not very hard to figure out anyways I guess I can just say that a section starts with me saying hello and ends with me saying goodbye That should be enough explaination now that I think about it Hey do you ever feel like you never have any idea what youre talking about Thats my entire life I just summarized it all in one sentence On an unrelated note I feel like half this LTE is just me talking about the LTE itself I mean press CTRL+F on this webpage then type LTE Look at all the times I use it in this text Not counting the lte in the word multe of course Dang now the search results will include that too Anyways half of this text is just me talking about how Im trying to get this text to be the longest Well the longest LTE anyways I still have a long way to go Im only % of the way there I mean minus the four month gap my estimation is that Ive only been writing this for not even two weeks So it makes sense that this LTE isnt very long yet Whenever I look at this webpage it looks long at first glance but the longer I look at it the more I realize how short it actually is Its something that I cant explain For real this time I just realized that none of this is helping the fact that half this LTE is about the LTE itself I should bring up a new topic but I dont feel comfortable talking about much else Why Because like I said I never have any idea what Im talking about Most of this LTE is just me talking about LTEs or languages Sometimes furries but I dont wanna go back into that territory at this point But it doesnt matter because Im still gonna write this LTE for as long as possible even if it means talking about the same things half the time Also LEARN VIESA Havent said that in a while so I might as well bring it back The documentation for Viesa is on this very website so go ahead and read it You might need to know some linguistic knowledge to understand it though In fact you probably wont understand most of it unless you know some amount about lingusitics so you have been warned If Viesa is too much for you Pig Latin will probably be better for you If its so easy that kids can learn it you can too Its a language you can learn in probably five minutes so why not give it a try You may also enjoy Ubbi Dubbi where you place ub before every vowel sound Its also a very easy language to learn although not quite as popular The thing is none of these are even real languages Theyre just codes and very simple codes at that You could probably crask Pig Latin or Ubbi Dubbi rather easily Viesa too actually But I still enjoy them occasionally even if Pig Latin and Ubbi Dubbi are inefficient and easy to crack and Viesa is easy to crack yet unneccesarily difficult I do make real languages but I never put in the effort to learn them to fluency At least I make them at all Heres a fun game I will open up a random page from a book and tell you the first word I see English Thats the word Stay tuned for more fun games as you read through this LTE Were back and were gonna play the same game as before Ready Subject Now were gonna do it again Reading And again Itself Constituent Grammar Colloquial Black Outline Add About four of those words were language related Youll never guess why Spoiler alert its a conlanging book Im running out of ideas now Im just gonna generate a random word and try to talk about it Forbid Thats the opposite of allow Im pretty sure I dont really know what else to say Well I guess I failed at generating a topic I could talk about You know whats weird My favorite word hasnt been used once in this entire text Im about to change that forever Epic Yup my favorite word is epic I use it on a regular basis I say Thats epic all the time Its a word I cant live without Hey Ive now written more of this text after the month gap than before it Just thought Id share that fact Also Im gonna try and write as much as possible in this LTE today Ive already written more today than the day I first said I was gonna write as much as possible so thats a good sign The thing is I dont know what to write about I need to write about something otherwise I wont write at all and I wont accomplish my goal Wait what goal should I set How many characters should I write today Im gonna try and get characters Ive already written almost today so from here I just have to write the equivellant of everything Ive already written today Im just gonna try it and see if I make it Maybe sometime in the future Ill do a bigger goal like or even in one day Actually I dont know if would even be possible for me It might be but it sounds like somewhat of a stretch for me to write that much in a single day Well see how long takes though Im already doing a bad job at this I havent typed anything here in several minutes I need a topic Um Vabungula I guess Basically its a conlang created by Bill Price in It amazes me how one can work on a single conlang for that long Most of the conlangs I start making die after minutes Anyways I really like it because um I dont know actually Theres not really anything about it thats super interesting other than how long its existed its just his personal conlang Maybe its the amount of development that went into it It has over dictionary entries and several texts written in the language Im sure most people reading this dont care about my language related talk but I gotta make this long Im desperate to reach my character goal Ive got to go I just found a website that generates random art from a seed I just put this entire text as the seed and it generated something quite nice I would put the picture here but I want this LTE to be nothing but text so I wont do that Ive been playing with this for a while now Many of the seeds produce boring pictures but some of them are nice For example I just used e as the seed and it produced a nice looking picture a looks nice too arguably nicer Ive been using nothing but the word nice to describe these pictures Maybe its time to get a bigger vocabulary b looks um good I dont have the right vocabulary for this I also dont feel like doing every single letter because the pictures take some time to generate But if you want to do it for yourself just go to randomartorg and try it out By the way this is another website I found through pointlesssitescom You know the same website that lead me to the FlamingChicken LTE which lead me to begin writing this whole thing But what made me discover pointlesssitescom Vsauce mentioned it But what made me discover Vsauce YouTube Reccomendations probably But what made me discover YouTube As far as I remember my dad showed it to me when I was So I would like to thank my dad for being the reason I started writing this Hes the one who showed me YouTube which reccomended me Vsauce which mentioned pointlesssitescom which brought me to the FlamingChicken LTE which inspired me to start my own LTE If he had never shown me YouTube I wouldnt be here writing this text and you wouldnt be reading it Well thats probably not true because I probably would have discovered YouTube by other means thus leading me to Vsauce leading me to Vsauce leading me to pointlesssitescom leading me to the FlamingChicken LTE leading me to okay I really need to stop now Ive gone too far But you know what I havent gone too far with This LTE I dont think I even can go too far with writing this text Unless this text gets so long that it surpasses the GB storage limit of Neocities In which case Ill need to upgrade to Supporter in order to get a GB storage limit But what if the text gets so long that is surpasses that I dont think Ill ever make it there I mean GB is about trillion characters So I think were good I still need to get to by the end of today Ive got to go Currently watching a livestream Its reminding me of when I used to livestream back in I still kinda miss those days But at the same time I was quite awkward and had zero social skills so Im not sure if Id want to go back At this point everything Ive written today is longer than what can fit on the screen at once At least on my computer screen It probably changes with different screen resolutions and devices But anyways its pretty unusual for that much of the LTE to be written in a single day I dont want to pressure myself into writing this much every day though Last time I forced myself to complete a certain amount of something every day it was overwhelming and I ended up losing motivation thus letting down all my fans who were anticipating the August th release date Okay the amount of eager fans was probably a number you could count on one hand but still By the way if youre wondering what this something was it was GoAnimated Garbage The Movie which was supposed to be an hour long episode of a series I made to make fun of random GoAnimate videos In case youre not the type of person who knows what GoAnimate is hoo boy Basically its a draganddrop animation website infamous for the grounded videos that people made with it among other types of videos Its this whole community that I neither can explain nor want to explain But I had somewhat of an association with that community back in the day On my YouTube channel I used to make a genre of GoAnimate video known as the OS video Typically an OS video is where some sort of hated character within the GoAnimate community forcefully installs their operating system onto a users computer and the user has to deal with this OS until they eventually find a way to destroy it I made five of these videos In chronological order Caillou OS Boots OS Franklin OS Little Bill OS and Crap OS X Caillou OS is the most viewed video on my main channel which is unsurprising since Caillou is pretty much THE character associated with the GoAnimate community When I made that video it was a big transition for my channel The channels name was changed from Infinite Budgets which had been my name since when I made crappy Roblox videos to Allisima All of my old videos were deleted with the exception of my Barney Errors which was yet another genre of GoAnimate video Basically a Barney error is when a users computer/console/whatever session is interrupted by a Barney Error a message informing the user that Barney has been killed and the device must not be turned off because its an important message Theres also a bomb thats placed in Barneys lair the timer for which is displayed in the error The user gets some amount of chances and every time the device is turned off the user looses a chance and the time until the bomb explodes decreases Eventually the user turns off the computer enough times that there are no more chances left the bomb explodes and some sort of punishment happens These punishments can range from having to downgrade your operating system to having your computer destroyed and in extreme cases even to death I once made a whole channel for Barney Errors where I made about twenty of them before quitting After that I eventually quit GoAnimate all together but I still made Crap OS X an OS video made with Powerpoint I also made an interactive OS parody called Windows Poop Editon again with Powerpoint Before that I also made one called Atch OS using my old Windows XP netbook I just checked to see if my old Weebly website still exists since theres an Atch OS download on there and I wanted to see if it dissapeared from existence or not Appearantly it does Im getting so much nostalgia from this website Its like a window into when I had fun making these videos on a regular basis Im way past my character goal now Im kinda glad I set this goal but again Im not gonna force myself to do it everyday I think Im gonna stop writing for today Bye Hey Im back Yes that hello wasnt original either since I already said it once Specifically after my sister seized the LTE and started spamming You remember that right I hope you read through this whole thing instead of just picking a random part which just happened to be this part and reading only a tiny bit Nah Im just kidding Read this text however you want to it doesnt matter if you read this entire text from start to finish or not I mean I did put some cringy stuff in here as I keep mentioning But its on the Internet and since recently on my homepage so I know people are gonna read it Really the only reason Im making this is because I have a weird obsession for writing giant walls of text Guess what I just added translations of this LTE into various conlangs on my website But theyre all very incomplete and I probably wont finish them ever I mean if Im gonna finish any of them twill probably be the Viesa translation since its the easiest to do Hey twills back I remember the very beginnings of this LTE when I first mentioned twill That was characters ago Appearantly Im measuring time with characters now Hey whats the average amount of text I write per day in this LTE The four month gap probably significantly drops that amount Lets see The trouble is finding out when I started writing this LTE because I dont know the exact date Im just gonna estimate that it was March based on the amount of times I said goodnight before I said Happy Pi Day Its not a very accurate measurement though because sometimes I stop writing for the day without saying goodnight But anyways from March to today July is days As of that previous sentence there are characters in this LTE characters divided by days equals about characters per day Thats not very much at all To get an idea of how short that is the first characters of this LTE consist of about words and sentences As I predicted the four months of no activity had a big impact on this number But what if we ignore the month gap which was from March to July Ive only been working on this LTE for ten days characters divided by days is about characters Thats much better It might be that big because of the characters I wrote yesterday I said I wouldnt do it every day but honestly Im feeling like doing a goal again today I think I might even go a bit higher than yesterday Lets do characters I have zero life outside of this LTE anyways so I think Ill make it As long as I keep typing about random stuff for the entire day Ill probably get past easily I think Im insane Literally all I do anymore is write this LTE My mom is almost certainly concered for me because I was in my room pretty much all of yesterday and my sister told her about how Im trying to write the longest text ever But enough about my descent into insanity for now Lets get this LTE to over characters today This is probably the most meta LTE in existence Like Ive said I talk about the LTE itself as much if not more than anything else By the way if I were to write as much as I did yesterday every day I would reach my goal in just days Now Im tempted to do that even though I said I wouldnt set a goal like that every day I think I might end up doing it subconciously I kinda wanna convince some other people I know online to start their own LTE Wouldnt it be fun if we all had our own LTEs They would probably all die within a day but at least I wouldnt be the only one writing an LTE in The most recently updated LTE Ive seen is the RainbowFluffySheep LTE which I believe was last updated in late That wasnt really that long ago but still I dont think its being updated anymore Now lets do an LTE Timeline The original FlamingChickens LTE was probably started sometime in and Hermnerps was started the same year The FlamingChickens LTE stopped in while the Hermnerps LTE actually lived on until although edits after the end of were rather sparce The Kenneth Iman LTE was started in and was last updated in The RainbowFluffySheep LTE both started and was last updated in March And of course the WhileTrue LTE was started in March and is still being updated today Wow years of LTEs I think my LTE is the only one still being updated It would be nice if someone else was writing their own LTE along with me But twill be hard to convince other people to waste their lives writing a useless wall of text You never know maybe an LTE that stopped being edited years ago will come back from the dead That seems kind of unlikely though Very strange fact incoming A certain word has not been used since the very beginning of this text Ready to learn what it is I shouldnt tell you actually Of course that would ruin it Unless you want me to ruin a really cool fact Surely you wouldnt want that to happen Okay Ill just tell you because Im probably gonna end up using it again someday or another The word is various If you search for various in this LTE youll only find it at the very beginning as well as here And I was gonna keep this a secret but just now I did this thing where if you take the first letter of each sentence it spells out VARIOUS Kinda clever I guess Anyways for those who are insane enough to be reading this entire thing from the start Wow you have quite the dedication My LTE isnt even the longest yet but perhaps in the future when it is the longest people will be challenging themselves to read the entire thing And maybe youre one of them Perhaps youre reading this long after Ive passed my goal in which case you still have quite a bit to go So I wish you luck on your Longest Text Ever reading adventure Ive been talking about LTEs all day For the past characters in fact I need to find something different to talk about But first I just had an idea pertaining LTEs I should compare this LTE to the longest joke in the world The longest joke in the world is characters long which is about how long Im trying to get this LTE by the end of today So if I reach my goal today this text will be longer than the longest joke in the world Thats pretty cool I would also be a quarter of the way to my goal But lets get back to finding something different to talk about I cant think of anything My sister is singing a song about wanting Subway I will never understand her What goes through her brain that makes her decide Yeah I think it would be a good idea to sing about how I really want Subway I dont get how her brain works She also likes eating paper I asked her and appearantly she was perfectly okay with me writing that in here She probably thinks nobodys ever gonna read this But shes gonna be wrong Eventually Now shes asking me to write about how she likes yogurt Because I didnt used to she says Shes eating mango yogurt and she has water in a Gatorade bottle Now Im asking her what else I should put in this text She says I should write about how theres wild sage where we live Now shes having hot chocolate She didnt ask me to write that but I told her I was going to write it and she said okay My sister might start her own Longest Text Ever again She says it will have only one word repeated throughout the entire text But I told her that it defeats the purpose of an LTE In the original FlamingChickens LTE one of the very first things that is written is I will just type and type and never ever use copy and paste Okay I just made a webpage for her LTE its gonna be an actual LTE this time Stay tuned for The Best Longest Text Ever as she calls it I think it should have just been called KKs Longest Text Ever or something but whatever She types really slow but I hope her LTE will be successful nonetheless Warning if you do go and read her LTE she spoils Spiderman Far From Home at the very beginning so be careful about that In fact shes basically typing the entire plot of the movie Well thats one way to increase your LTEs length I guess My sister is listening to her terrible songs instead of writing her LTE Well she has her LTE page open but shes not writing anything and is singing instead Actually shes writing stuff now so ignore everything I said previously Shes still writing the entire plot Her LTE is now characters which isnt very long but shes only been working on it for an hour Plus shes a slow typer She types everything with one hand It might take a while for her LTE to get to this level But assuming she keeps writing it and doesnt forget about it after today itll get pretty long eventually I still need to write characters today My sister is watching a cringy video made by our old elementary school They became a French immersion school after I left She found one of the videos I was in oh god I cant stand to look at that video It hurts me to think about those days My sisters LTE webpage has text now Maybe I should create a page linking to all the LTEs I know about I think Ill do that Boom it is done I think Im gonna also put a link to it on this page There thats done as well Guys Im not sure if Im gonna make it to I still have characters to go I was completely off earlier I dont have left to go and theres not much left of the day In retrospect it was probably a bad idea to make a goal for the day in the first place After all LTE writing is supposed to be fun Sort of Theres zero need to make unneccesary deadlines I think it just reduces the fun as well as the part of my life that isnt just writing huge walls of text From here on out I declare characterperday goals abolished I will no longer make attempts to write a certain amount in a single day I should have listened to my past self who said not to do goals every day But I didnt and now I regret it But anyways heres a fun fact about this LTE excluding my upcoming usage the pronoun he is only used twice in this LTE and they both refer to my dad On the other hand the pronoun she is used forty times Almost all of these refer to my sister Only one refers to my mom I guess I just really like talking about the weird stuff my sister does But not as much as being meta and talking about my own LTE Heres another fun fact LTE is the fourteenth most common word in this text Thats insane Its more common than words youd expect to be common like you Im for be about was and so on I really need to talk about other things once in a while But since I have zero creativity I always resort to talking about the same topics From what Ive seen most other LTEs are pretty diverse but mine isnt at all Honestly this is likely the most boring LTE to read But my absolute lack of creativity means its probably gonna stay that way for a long time Im tired so Im gonna go to sleep Maybe Ill be more creative by tomorrow Probably not Anyways goodnight Hey Im back and I dont feel any more creative But I did have a dream last night so Im gonna talk about that Last night I dreamt that I was in one of our old houses and I saw that someone made a video roasting Viesa They talked about how you shouldnt say dog in Viesa because appearantly deeg is bad or something I dont know Then they said the rule where W becomes V is weird but I dont remember the reason they said it I didnt really care about how they roasted my language Then I watched a Minecraft video for whatever reason and then the dream ended How do other LTE writers have so many topics to talk about All I ever talk about is either LTEs themselves or the fact that all I ever talk about is LTEs Theres no diversity I very rarely talk about anything else And when I do its usually about languages and lasts only a few sentences There I deleted it Oh you dont have any context Basically I wrote a bunch of depressing stuff then I decided to delete it all I knew I was going to regret it later in the same way I regret writing all that stuff about furries Not that I think theres anything wrong with being a furry its just that it personally makes me uncomfortable looking back on it Im not even into that stuff as much anymore I dont watch furry YouTube and I dont talk about how much I want a fursuit/go to a convention Thats a part of me thats slowly disappearing Okay Im gonna stop talking about that because I literally just said how I regret talking about it in this text You know Ive been feeling kind of down about this LTE lately because as I just mentioned all I ever talk about is this LTE itself theres no diversity blah blah blah Its especially been like that ever since the four month gap In fact I barely talked about LTEs before that gap Its like I lost all my creativity after four months You know what Im officially gonna say this If for some reason you are reading this before you decide you want to start reading this entire text READ EVERYTHING FROM WOW IT HAS BEEN A WHILE TO HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK BECAUSE YOU WILL LIKELY DIE OF BOREDOM DUE TO THE MONOTONOUS TOPICS There now Im gonna try and forget that half this LTE is the same exact boring topic I will also try to avoid writing about the same exact boring topic for the rest of this text Lets celebrate the End of Monotonous Topics EMT by talking about how we my sister and I had lunch and did various other things with our grandpa So grandpa asked if we wanted to have lunch and spend an afternoon with him and we said yes Then he picked us up and we went to a nearby town where we had lunch went to a museum which was a house built in as well as the towns first hospital and got ice cream from what is appearently one of the best ice cream places in the country according to grandpa So today was a fun day Im gonna go now Bye Hey Im back Thats the fifth time Ive said that I need to come up with more original nah whatever Anyways I had a dream last night which was basically a whole movie I dont remember most of All I remember is playing a keyboard at the store for some reason and that the dream ended with a random car horn Oh and there was Minecraft involved in the beginning which Im pretty sure is becoming a recurring theme in my dreams I dont know why that happened because I rarely play Minecraft anymore Do any of yall remember the DVD screensaver meme That was one of my favorite memes For those who dont know what Im talking about many DVD players had this screensaver where it was a DVD logo bouncing around the screen The big moment that everyone anticipates is when the logo hits the corner of the screen perfectly because well its just so SATISFYING I used to watch a livestream that was literally just this screensaver running endlessly And when it hit the corner it was a huge celebration for both me and everyone else watching I got so excited when the logo hit the corner My computers screensaver is even still a DVD screensaver But nowadays when I see it hit the corner I dont have as much enthusiasm as I used to Ive just seen it too many times for it to be exciting anymore Plus the meme isnt even a thing anymore I doubt that livestream is even still running But you never know so Im gonna check to see if its still going Oh wow it is That was the last thing I expected to see in July But only four people are watching it which makes sense The title now says DVD Logo Screensaver For Year even though it hasnt quite been going on for a year But when it hits that point perhaps thats when it will finally end It should have ended months ago if you ask me Yup I was right Theres a countdown on the livestream to when it ends and it says days hours minutes and seconds Wow the corner hit and wall hit numbers are much bigger now The most corner hits Id seen is around or so but now its at The wall hits used to be in the hundredthousands now its at over two and a half million Hello I have returned There I came up with something original to say Anyways I just combined every single LTE I know of including this one and put it onto one single page on a Wikia wiki called No Rules Wiki That wiki exactly as you would expect from the title I found it a while ago and I thought it was about time I made a contribution even if pasting over half a million characters into a single article is breaking some rule Ive been wanting to make Viesa an actual conlang for so long now I think its long overdue at this point Hey Im back again These sections are getting shorter and shorter each day But oh well I just discovered how much I like the word number I dont know why but its just so fun to say I think Ive liked that word ever since I was a toddler learning my numbers I remember thinking it was a fun word even back then At that time I had two little electronic toys one was orange and for numbers and one was purple and for letters Im pretty sure those were the colors I also vaguely remember having a fan that lit up and displayed custom messages I havent seen anything like that since then All I hear right now is Baby Shark being blasted upstairs You know that song right I dont know who doesnt know it at this point I cant think of a single person Ive seen that doesnt know what that song is Dang ever since the EMT I havent been writing as much in this text Looks like LTEs were all I could talk about Oh well How many times have I said oh well Probably a lot About eight times in fact Im back again I went a full day without writing anything into this LTE yesterday There were a lot of things happening that day so I didnt feel like writing I couldve written at least a little bit but I didnt Time for me to use this LTE as my dream journal yet again I had a dream where my domain was exin or something like that instead of whiletrue so that was a thing I also had a dream where there was this game that I thought existed in the real world but it didnt Dreams do that sometimes I dont remember much about the game but it involved the Simpsons I guess Also I was in a weird store where they had an iCarly laptop And a bunch of gift cards Thats all I remember For now at least My sister does not like synthwave She says its repetitive the sounds they use dont sound like music and she doesnt like how it doesnt have lyrics First of all shes hypocritical because she always listens to the same songs on repeat And why does it matter that it doesnt have words Why does she think every single piece of music in existence has to have words YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR OPINIONS THERE That was a reference to a cringy GoAnimator that no one reading this will get unless you came to this website from my YouTube channel which you subscribed to during my OS video days Anyways synthwave is objectively the best genre of music I remember hearing HOME Resonance for the first time in a Discord voice chat and it was magical I wish I could listen to that song for the first time again That was how I got into synthwave You know what my favorite color combination is Yellow text on a magenta background Oh and dont forget the Comic Sans That is just pure beauty right there In fact its used in the first frame well close enough of history of the entire world i guess which makes me love that video even more Were at characters sentences and words Weird how all those counts hit such round numbers in one day huh I need to stick to the EMT so I should stop talking about that My sister is attempting to build a Lego city Her goal is to have three buildings since she doesnt have THAT much Lego Have you noticed how quickly Ive been switching topics in this text Thats because I cant talk about anything for a long time That is unless that thing is languages or LTEs I am currently trying to revive a language my sister and I started making a while back Sometimes my sister has days when she doesnt hate languages for some reason then she ends up starting one But of course she regained her hate and abandoned it Now Im the only one working on the language By the way the language is called Lazay which was the successor to Zula the first language we made together which is now deleted We started writing the language on paper but then I started a Google Doc Im sure the papers are still here somewhere Im just too lazy to find them Im back again I havent been ending these sections with goodbyes recently But whatever Were on our way to IKEA to get a dresser for my room Were listening to Queens of the Stone Age right now and Im just waiting for Fortress to come on I sing that song in Viesa but I make up half of the lyrics It goes.
