# Algorithm Analysis Homework 1

Question 1-a: Find two closest element in array with bruteforce.
Question 1-b: Find two closest element in array with more effective way
- Perform an algorithm analysis for both cases.
- Analiyze worst, best and average case complexities for both questions.
- Add your report to applications screenshots.

Question 2: Print a Von-Neumann Matrix in desired size
- Print matrix, total black row count and, black row count for each row.

- Example :  
n = 3  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0  
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0  
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0  
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
  
Black Squares in Rows = [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 5, 3, 1, 0]  
Total Number of black squares = 25
