# Dynamic Programing
- Teams A and B will play a match until one of them has n wins. 
- Team A's probability of winning the match is p for each match, and the probability of losing is 1-p. 
- Hence the probability of a draw is not available. 
- Team A wins n games to win the series and total game count is 2n+1
- In case A must win j matches to win, the probability of A winning the series is P (i, j).

## Process Steps:
- Design an algorithm with dynamic programming using P (i, j), write the recurrence relation.
- In a series of 7 games (4 fields win) when team A has 0.6 probability of winning a match.
Calculate the probability of team A winning.
- Use dynamic programming approach and build an algorithm in C language.
