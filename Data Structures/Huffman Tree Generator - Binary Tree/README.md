# Generate Huffman Tree

- In this assignment, you need to code one of the most common lossless data compression method
Huffman Coding's algorithm.
- You need to design an algorithm to create Huffman Tree for given text.

## Process Steps:
- Calculate frequency of each letter and store them into a linked list.
- Sort nodes by letters frequency.
- Convert that list into a tree.
- Print the huffman tree level by level.

## Rules:
- Program must be implemented in C language
- Report file must contains descriptions, diagrams, figures and tables
- Report must contain output for "huffman coding is a data compression algorithm" word.
