# Using Breadth First Search (BFS) on Graf

- The Small World Hypothesis (Small World Phenomenon) is the assumption put forward by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s that any two people in the world are at most six degrees of separation through people they know. 
- According to this hypothesis, the number of Kevin Bacon of an actor is the minimum number of movies that actor is away from Kevin Bacon. Kevin Bacon's Kevin Bacon number is 0. According to calculations, many actors' Kevin Bacon number is 2 or 3. 
- For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Bacon did not act in the same movie but Arnold Schwarzenegger and Stephen Furst played together in the movie Scavenger Hunt. 
- Stephen Furst also starred with Kevin Bacon in the movie Animal House. 
- Therefore, Arnold Schwarzenegger's Kevin Bacon number is 2.

## Process Steps:
- Calculate the total number of actors in each Kevin Bacon issue for the input file given.
- Give these people who are not on the same subnet as the number of people with an infinite number of Kevin Bacon.

- For the input file given, find the Kevin Bacon number of a named actor and print the information showing the link in the format below.

Brad Pitt’s Kevin Bacon number is 2

Brad Pitt-Julia Roberts : Ocean's Eleven (2001)
 
Julia Roberts – Kevin Bacon : Flatliners (1990) 


-When your program is run, when an actor is asked once, save the Kevin Bacon information of this actor in a table and when the same actor is asked again, instead of making calculations on the network again, read the information from this table and print it on the screen.

## Rules:
- Program must be implemented in C language
- Report file must contains descriptions, diagrams, figures and tables
- For the attached 3 .txt files, calculate how many people are in each Kevin Bacon number and take the screenshots and add them into the report file.
- Report must contain output for:

Use the "input3.txt" file for input, give the output calculating the Kevin Bacon number for Meryl Streep, Nicolas Cage, Elie Samaha, Dakota Fanning and Adile Naşit.
